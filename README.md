# Json Login System

## It is a simple class which uses the json file to store and retrieve the username and passwords, built for small applications which does not use database much often (eg. filemanager)

## If someone reads that file will the passwords get exposed?

### A big no!.If you want to store password in the json file you must use password_hash as demonstrated in the sample
